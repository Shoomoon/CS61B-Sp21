I understand your desire to prevent the error entirely. Here's how we can achieve that:

**1. Consistent State Management:**

The issue arises from the `transformer_dim_reduction()` method where the `all_cols_to_drop` list is generated based on the `train_data` dataframe. However, in some cases, dimensionality reduction might also be applied to `train_data` within this method, potentially removing columns present in the `all_cols_to_drop` list. This inconsistency leads to the `KeyError` when attempting to drop non-existent columns.

**Solution:**

* **Option A:** Recalculate `all_cols_to_drop` AFTER dimensionality reduction is performed on `train_data`. This ensures that the columns to be dropped are identified based on the current, reduced dataframe.

* **Option B:** Store the `all_cols_to_drop` within the object instance and only update it when feature dropping is explicitly triggered.

**2. Safer Column Dropping:**

Instead of directly dropping columns using the `all_cols_to_drop` list, you can check for column presence in the dataframe before attempting to remove them.

**Implementation:**

```python
def transformer_dim_reduction(self, train_data='', test_data='', val_data=''):
    # ... your existing code

    # Recalculate all_cols_to_drop if dimensionality reduction is applied
    if self.params['dim_reduction']:
        all_cols_to_drop = self.get_columns_to_drop(train_data)  # Recalculate based on the updated train_data

    # Safer column dropping
    if not test_data.empty:
        cols_to_drop = [col for col in all_cols_to_drop if col in test_data.columns]  # Filter existing columns
        test_data = test_data.drop(cols_to_drop)

    # ... rest of your code
```

**Explanation:**

*   We added the condition to recalculate `all_cols_to_drop` after dimensionality reduction (if applied) to maintain consistency.
*   Before dropping from `test_data`, we create a filtered list (`cols_to_drop`) containing only those columns from `all_cols_to_drop` that are actually present in `test_data`.

Feel free to choose the option that best suits you
